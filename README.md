## General info.

Upon accessing the application, the user is greeted with a random fact of the day. The user is then able to pull up an event that took place on a specific day by utilizing the provided calendar. Because number rules the world, the user is able to type in a specific numbe and is then presented with an interesting fact centered around that number.

Nalej is information overload at your fingertips.
